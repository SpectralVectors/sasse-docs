Each image is a seamless, tiling 2K traditional art texture, created in Krita, and named after the brush used to create it.

They are designed to be used with the Shaders' Surface, Light Band or Rim Light inputs, and can be animated using the TimeStep nodes from the Utility section. 

They also provide a more stylized alternative to Blender's procedural textures.
