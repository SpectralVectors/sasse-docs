This is a convenience folder for anyone who wants to modify or extend any of the shaders used in the Library.

**NOTE: Many shader controls will be set via Attributes tied to the Geometry it is assigned to, and some shaders are texture mapped to their intended Geometry.**

_e.g.: You can either delete the Attribute Node in the Shader editor if you want to change the color, or assign a Color Attribute to your Geometry. And, if the shader was originally mapped to a plane, it may take some adjusting to map it to a sphere._
