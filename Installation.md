## Installation
Download the .zip file, unzip and place the folder in the directory you use for your Blender Assets.

Blender's Asset Library organizes via folder, rather than file, so the library will be added via its folder name.

_e.g. I have a 'Blender' folder for all my Blender related files (blends, meshes, textures, renders etc) that contains an 'Assets' folder. After downloading and decompressing 'SASSE.zip', I place the 'SASSE' folder in 'Blender/Assets'._

Then, in Blender, go to 'Edit > Preferences > File Paths', under 'Asset Libraries' click the + button and add the path to the folder.

_e.g. in this case, the final path would be 'Blender/Assets/SASSE'._

You can then choose if you want to append or link assets by default.
