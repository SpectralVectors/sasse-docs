## Usage
After Installation you should see SASSE as an option in your Asset Browser.

If you are not sure how to access the Asset Browser, the simplest way is to open a Default Blender file, move your mouse cursor down into the Timeline, and click on the Clock icon.

This will open up a menu that allows you to change to a different area, on the far right side, in the middle, click 'Asset Browser', with a Library icon.

Once the Asset Browser is open, you should see 'SASSE Library' on the left side.

_If you don't see SASSE Library in the panel on the left, double-check the installation instructions and ensure that you are using an up to date version of Blender._

### Assets
Generally static objects, ground planes and curves that can be dragged or drawn directly into the scene.

### Effects
A varied series of effects that can either be dragged directly into the scene, or directly onto an existing scene object.

_e.g. drag the Action Cylinder or Planes directly into the scene to use them, but effect like Impact Cracks, Electric Sphere and Trails need to be applied to an object to work._

### Lights
Standard Blender lights with custom shadow settings.

### Linework
Drag and Drop outlines, create inner lines via edge marks, or draw lines onto objects or into the scene.

### Materials
Drag and Drop materials, Base and Specialized Shaders are general purpose, Foliage Shaders are designed to work with the Foliage Assets, and Individual Asset Shaders is a convenience folder.

### Node Groups
Drag and Drop seamless textures, frame step utilities, foliage textures, and shader node groups into the Shader or Geometry Node Editor.
