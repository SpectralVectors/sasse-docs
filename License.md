## License
You may use, combine and customize these assets in any still, gif, short or long-form animation or video, television show, film, web-series, website, interactive media or video-game.

They are licensed for commercial or non-commercial use and credit is not required (though it is appreciated!).

You may not resell or redistribute the assets in whole or in part in a blend file, an asset library, or any method that causes a user to receive a working copy of the asset.

I want to be permissive with licensing to allow users to create whatever they want with these assets, while preserving the ability to monetize my efforts. 

If you have a usage for the assets that you feel is not explicitly covered above, then please get in touch and likely something can be worked out.

I wanted to price the library so that it would be affordable for individuals, and, as such, one purchase can be considered a single 'seat' license for studio usage.
